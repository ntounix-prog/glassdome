# Glassdome Overseer - Autonomous Entity

## 🧠 Concept

The Overseer is **not a simple API** - it's an **autonomous entity** that acts as a senior operations engineer running 24/7.

### Traditional API (What we DON'T have):
```
User Request → API Endpoint → Execute → Done
```

### Overseer Entity (What we DO have):
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  OVERSEER (Always Running)                        │
│                                                   │
│  ├─ MONITOR: Continuously watch everything       │
│  ├─ GATE: Validate all requests (can say NO)     │
│  ├─ DECIDE: Use RAG to make intelligent choices  │
│  ├─ EXECUTE: Run approved operations safely      │
│  ├─ LEARN: Remember failures, avoid repeating    │
│  └─ PROTECT: Prevent disasters                   │
│                                                   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## 📦 What We Built

### 1. **SystemState** (`glassdome/overseer/state.py`)
**Purpose:** The Overseer's memory - knows everything

**Tracks:**
- All VMs across all platforms (Proxmox, ESXi, AWS, Azure)
- All hosts and their health status
- All services running on VMs
- All pending/approved/completed requests
- Resource availability

**Persistence:**
- Saves to `.overseer_state.json`
- Survives restarts
- JSON-serialized with proper enum handling

**Example State:**
```json
{
  "vms": {
    "114": {
      "id": "114",
      "name": "ubuntu-powerhouse",
      "platform": "proxmox",
      "status": "running",
      "ip": "192.168.3.50",
      "is_production": true,
      "services": ["minecraft"]
    }
  },
  "hosts": {
    "proxmox:192.168.3.2": {
      "platform": "proxmox",
      "status": "healthy",
      "resources": {"cpu_available": 16}
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. **OverseerEntity** (`glassdome/overseer/entity.py`)
**Purpose:** The brain - autonomous decision-making entity

**4 Concurrent Loops (run forever):**

#### Loop 1: **Monitor Loop** (every 30s)
- Checks health of all platforms
- Detects issues (VMs with unknown status, degraded hosts)
- Consults RAG for similar past issues
- Attempts automatic resolution

#### Loop 2: **Execution Loop**
- Processes approved requests from queue
- Executes operations safely
- Updates state after completion
- Logs failures for RAG learning

#### Loop 3: **State Sync Loop** (every 60s)
- Discovers new VMs/hosts
- Updates statuses
- Keeps state current with reality

#### Loop 4: **Health Check Loop** (every 5 min)
- Monitors Overseer's own health
- Reports stats (requests processed, failures, etc.)
- Self-diagnosis

**Request Gating (Safety Layer):**

The Overseer **GATES ALL REQUESTS** and can deny them:

```python
result = await overseer.receive_request(
    action='destroy_vm',
    params={'vm_id': '114'},
    user='noob-engineer'
)

# Overseer response:
{
  'approved': False,
  'reason': 'VM 114 is production. Add --force-production to confirm.'
}
```

**Safety Checks:**
1. ✅ Validate request format
2. ✅ Check user permissions (TODO)
3. ✅ Consult RAG (have we seen this fail before?)
4. ✅ Protect production VMs
5. ✅ Resource validation
6. ✅ Prevent mass destruction

**RAG Integration:**
- Consults RAG when confused/uncertain
- Learns from past failures
- Warns about historically problematic operations

---

### 3. **Overseer Service** (`glassdome/overseer/service.py`)
**Purpose:** FastAPI wrapper for HTTP/REST access

**API Endpoints:**

#### Status & Information
- `GET /` - Health check
- `GET /status` - Overseer status + stats
- `GET /state/summary` - State summary
- `GET /state/vms` - List all VMs
- `GET /state/vms/{vm_id}` - Get VM details
- `GET /state/hosts` - List all hosts

#### Request Submission
- `POST /request/deploy_vm` - Deploy VM
- `POST /request/destroy_vm` - Destroy VM
- `POST /request/start_vm` - Start VM
- `POST /request/stop_vm` - Stop VM
- `POST /request/generic` - Generic action

#### Request Tracking
- `GET /requests/pending` - List pending
- `GET /requests/{request_id}` - Get status

#### Administrative
- `GET /admin/stats` - Statistics
- `POST /admin/force_state_sync` - Force sync

---

### 4. **Overseer CLI** (`scripts/overseer_cli.py`)
**Purpose:** Command-line interface for humans

**Commands:**
```bash
# Status & Info
./overseer_cli.py status        # Get Overseer status
./overseer_cli.py vms           # List all VMs
./overseer_cli.py vm 114        # Get VM details
./overseer_cli.py hosts         # List all hosts

# Request Operations
./overseer_cli.py deploy proxmox ubuntu     # Deploy Ubuntu on Proxmox
./overseer_cli.py destroy 114 --force       # Destroy VM (with force)

# Tracking
./overseer_cli.py requests      # List pending requests
```

**Example Output:**
```
======================================================================
🧠 GLASSDOME OVERSEER - STATUS
======================================================================
Total VMs:        1
Running VMs:      1
Production VMs:   1
Total Hosts:      1
Healthy Hosts:    1
Services:         0
Pending Requests: 0
======================================================================
```

### 5. **Docker Compose** (`docker-compose.overseer.yml`)
**Purpose:** Containerize Overseer for deployment

**Features:**
- Mounts state file for persistence
- Mounts RAG index (read-only)
- Mounts `.env` for credentials
- Health checks
- Auto-restart
- Exposes port 8001

**Usage:**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.overseer.yml up -d
```

## ❌ What's Missing (Workflow Gaps)

### Critical Gaps

#### 1. **State Discovery is Placeholder**
**Problem:** State sync loop doesn't actually discover VMs from platforms

**Current:**
```python
async def state_sync_loop(self):
    # TODO: Implement actual state discovery
    pass
```

**Needed:**
```python
async def state_sync_loop(self):
    # Connect to Proxmox, list all VMs
    proxmox_vms = await self.proxmox.list_vms()
    for vm in proxmox_vms:
        self.state.add_vm(vm)
    
    # Same for ESXi, AWS, Azure
    ...
```

**Impact:** Overseer doesn't know about VMs unless manually added to state

---

#### 2. **Execution Handlers are Stubs**
**Problem:** Deployment/destroy actions don't actually call platform clients

**Current:**
```python
async def _execute_deploy_vm(self, params):
    # TODO: Implement actual deployment
    return {'status': 'success', 'vm_id': 'fake-id'}
```

**Needed:**
```python
async def _execute_deploy_vm(self, params):
    platform = params['platform']
    if platform == 'proxmox':
        result = await self.proxmox.create_vm(params)
        vm = VM(id=result['vm_id'], ...)
        self.state.add_vm(vm)
    ...
```

**Impact:** Requests are "approved" but nothing actually happens

---

#### 3. **No User/Permission System**
**Problem:** Anyone can make any request

**Needed:**
- User authentication (API keys, tokens, etc.)
- Role-based permissions (admin vs engineer vs read-only)
- Audit log of who did what

**Impact:** No security, no accountability

---

#### 4. **Platform Health Checks are Unimplemented**
**Problem:** Monitor loop can't actually check if Proxmox/ESXi is healthy

**Needed:**
```python
async def _check_proxmox_health(self):
    try:
        status = await self.proxmox.get_status()
        if status['cpu_usage'] > 90:
            return {'status': 'degraded', 'reason': 'High CPU'}
        return {'status': 'healthy'}
    except Exception:
        return {'status': 'down'}
```

**Impact:** Overseer can't detect infrastructure problems

---

#### 5. **No Issue Resolution Logic**
**Problem:** Overseer detects issues but doesn't fix them

**Current:**
```python
async def _handle_issue(self, issue):
    # Consult RAG
    # TODO: Implement actual resolution
    pass
```

**Needed:**
- VM stuck in deploying → Force stop/restart
- Host degraded → Migrate VMs
- Service down → Restart service

**Impact:** Overseer is reactive, not proactive

---

#### 6. **No Notification System**
**Problem:** Overseer can't alert humans about problems

**Needed:**
- Slack integration (already designed)
- Email integration (already designed)
- Alert on critical issues
- Daily status reports

**Impact:** Team doesn't know when things break

---

#### 7. **No Frontend Integration**
**Problem:** React dashboard doesn't exist yet

**Needed:**
- Connect React to Overseer API
- Real-time VM status dashboard
- Drag-and-drop deployment UI
- Request approval interface

**Impact:** No visual control panel

---

#### 8. **No Multi-VM Deployments (Scenarios)**
**Problem:** Overseer only handles single VMs

**Needed:**
- Deploy entire networks (7-10 VMs)
- Multi-platform scenarios
- Network configuration
- Service orchestration

**Impact:** Can't deploy cyber range environments

---

### Minor Gaps

- [ ] Resource calculation is stub
- [ ] No cleanup of old completed requests
- [ ] No metrics/prometheus export
- [ ] No backup/restore of state
- [ ] No CLI for administrative tasks
- [ ] No integration tests
- [ ] No CI/CD pipeline

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Prioritized)

### Phase 1: Make It Functional (2-3 hours)
1. Implement state discovery (connect to real platforms)
2. Implement execution handlers (actually deploy/destroy VMs)
3. Test full request → execution → state update flow

### Phase 2: Make It Safe (1-2 hours)
4. Add basic user authentication
5. Implement platform health checks
6. Add Slack notifications for critical events

### Phase 3: Make It Useful (3-4 hours)
7. Build React frontend basics
8. Implement multi-VM scenario deployments
9. Add network orchestration

### Phase 4: Make It Enterprise (2-3 hours)
10. Add audit logging
11. Add metrics/monitoring
12. Complete documentation

---

## 🧪 Testing the Overseer

### Test 1: CLI Status
```bash
./scripts/overseer_cli.py status
```

**Expected:** Shows summary of current state

**✅ WORKING**

---

### Test 2: Request Approval
```bash
./scripts/overseer_cli.py deploy proxmox ubuntu --user test
```

**Expected:** Request approved and queued

**⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING:** Approves but doesn't execute

---

### Test 3: Production Protection
```bash
# Add production VM to state
./scripts/overseer_cli.py destroy 114
```

**Expected:** Denied (VM 114 is production)

**✅ WORKING**

---

### Test 4: Run Overseer Service
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn glassdome.overseer.service:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

**Expected:** API starts, autonomous loops running

**🔄 UNTESTED** (would run indefinitely)

---

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### 1. **Entity != API**
The Overseer is fundamentally different from a REST API:
- APIs are reactive (wait for calls)
- Entities are proactive (always watching)

### 2. **State is Everything**
Without persistent state, the Overseer has no memory
- Must survive restarts
- Must be the source of truth
- Must be fast to query

### 3. **Request Gating is Critical**
Preventing bad operations is more important than enabling good ones
- Can save production from accidents
- Forces explicit confirmations
- Creates audit trail

### 4. **RAG Makes It Intelligent**
Consulting past experiences prevents repeated mistakes
- "We tried this before and it failed"
- "Last time we did X, Y happened"
- Enables learning over time

### 5. **Workflow Gaps Emerge from Use**
Building the entity revealed what's missing:
- State discovery
- Execution handlers
- Health checks
- Notifications

---

## 📝 Summary

**We built the skeleton of an autonomous ops engineer:**

✅ **Architecture is solid**
- 4 concurrent loops
- State management
- Request gating
- RAG integration

❌ **Connections are missing**
- Doesn't actually talk to platforms yet
- Doesn't execute real deployments
- Doesn't discover infrastructure

**Next:** Fill in the execution handlers to make it functional.
